THE MAZE PROJECT - MVP (A 3D Game Created Using SDL2)

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Maze Game with SDL2:

Explanation:

Walls:

Create a 2D array to represent the maze and draw walls using the SDL2 graphics library.
Represent the walls with rectangles or lines.
Use the 2D array to store maze data and render walls using SDL2.
Orientation:

Use arrow keys to control the player’s movement and rotation in the maze.
Handle user input with SDL_Event.
Update the player's position and orientation based on user input.
Move:

Implement basic player movement allowing movement forward, backward, left, and right within the maze.
Update the player's position according to their orientation and user input.
Collision Detection:

Add collision detection to prevent the player from moving through walls.
Implement a function to check for collisions and stop movement if a collision occurs.
Parser:

Create a parser to read maze data from a text file and store it in a 2D array.
Implement a function to read and store maze data.
Draw the Map:

Draw the maze using data from the 2D array.
Use different colors to distinguish walls from the ground and ceiling.
Textures:

Add basic textures to walls using SDL2’s texture rendering functions.
Implement a function to load and render wall textures.
These features form the core of a basic maze game using SDL2.

Data Modelling

USER STORY

As an end user, I want to play a maze game created with SDL2 to enjoy solving the maze and challenging myself to improve my speed and accuracy.

When starting the game, I want to see a main menu with options to start a new game, load a saved game, or quit.
If I start a new game, I want to choose the maze's difficulty level, including its size and the number of obstacles.
Once the game starts, I want to see the maze on the screen, controlling a character with the arrow keys. The character should move smoothly and quickly.
I want a timer counting down the time to complete the maze and a score reflecting my progress.
While navigating the maze, I want to collect coins or other rewards to increase my score and encounter obstacles that make it harder to reach the end.
Upon reaching the maze's end, I want a congratulatory message displaying my final score and completion time, with an option to save the game.
Throughout the game, I want to hear sound effects corresponding to actions like collecting coins or hitting obstacles, and background music to enhance the experience.
Finally, I want the game to have high-quality graphics and animations, making it visually appealing and engaging.
